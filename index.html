      <p>
        <strong>Cono Plant:</strong> This plant showed slow and steady vertical growth. It
        maintained a healthy green color and its shape became fuller over time.
        I noticed new branches forming by the second month. <br> <br>
        <strong>Ficus Benjamina:</strong> The
        Ficus adapted quickly and grew well. It developed more
        flexible branches and shiny, healthy leaves. Some leaf drop occurred
        early, but it stabilized with regular care.  <br> <br>
        <strong>Guava Plant:</strong> The guava plant
        was the most interactive to monitor. New leaves appeared within the
        first few weeks. By the third month, small flower buds started forming,
        showing healthy development.
